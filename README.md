# json-schema-to-typescript-cached-name-bug-repro

Repro of json-schema-to-typescript bug where previous types names are used. See https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript/issues/370.

## Usage

Run:
```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

You will see an output where both generated outputs contain `MyType1` rather than the first containing `MyType1` and the second containing `MyType2`:

```typescript
result 1:  /* tslint:disable */
/**
 * This file was automatically generated by json-schema-to-typescript.
 * DO NOT MODIFY IT BY HAND. Instead, modify the source JSONSchema file,
 * and run json-schema-to-typescript to regenerate this file.
 */

export interface MyType1 {
  id: string;
  [k: string]: unknown;
}

result 2:  /* tslint:disable */
/**
 * This file was automatically generated by json-schema-to-typescript.
 * DO NOT MODIFY IT BY HAND. Instead, modify the source JSONSchema file,
 * and run json-schema-to-typescript to regenerate this file.
 */

export interface MyType1 {
  id: string;
  [k: string]: unknown;
}
```

You can also try:
```sh
yarn add json-schema-to-typescript@9
yarn start
```

This confirms that this behaved as expected in v9:

```typescript
result 1:  /* tslint:disable */
/**
 * This file was automatically generated by json-schema-to-typescript.
 * DO NOT MODIFY IT BY HAND. Instead, modify the source JSONSchema file,
 * and run json-schema-to-typescript to regenerate this file.
 */

export interface MyType1 {
  id: string;
  [k: string]: unknown;
}

result 2:  /* tslint:disable */
/**
 * This file was automatically generated by json-schema-to-typescript.
 * DO NOT MODIFY IT BY HAND. Instead, modify the source JSONSchema file,
 * and run json-schema-to-typescript to regenerate this file.
 */

export interface MyType2 {
  id: string;
  [k: string]: unknown;
}
```
